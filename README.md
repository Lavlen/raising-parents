# Raising Parents 

[View site here](https://lavlen.github.io/raising-parents/)

The site provides information useful to parents and guardians who are raising children, from toddlers to teenagers. The site aims to discuss and provide literature and other resources that deal with the most common problems experienced by those raising children. The owners of the site believe that many of the common parenting issues are often caused by the parents or perpetuated by them due to adopting parenting styles that are based on myths about what is best for children, how they learn and how resilient they are or because of learnt behaviour projected through the media, their community and the wider society. 
The owners of the site want parents to be more successful at raising children and seek to do so by focusing on getting parents to first troubleshoot themselves as an initial approach to resolving short and long-term issues.
