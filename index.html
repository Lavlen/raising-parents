                <h2>Are Our Kids Using Half their Brains!</h2>
                <h6>Lavin Lennon, July 21, 2021</h6>
                <br>
                <p>In early childhood (nursery / preschool) there appears to be an appreciation for development of both
                    sides of the brain. Activities such as drawing, finger painting, singing, role play, play dough and
                    number songs, writing and circle time are a few activities which focus on this development; very
                    successfully might I add. However when children begin to grow and develop through their school
                    careers the emphasis on developing both sides of the brain seem to diminish and greater emphasis is
                    placed on the left side and are reinforced by way of tests such as CAT’s, SAT’s, GCSE.s etc...

                        <p>Whilst children are still encouraged to participate in dance, music, drama and other creative
                            activities; this tends to be much more of an option than science, maths or English (which
                            are essential). If the decline in activities which develop the right side of your child’s
                            brain begins soon after children start primary school, what can we as parents do to continue
                            this essential development, it seems obvious doesn't it! provide a replacement to fill this
                            void? If we sent our children to school and suddenly the school stopped feeding them at
                            lunchtimes, what would we do (apart from find a new school!) That’s right we'd supply a
                            packed lunch for the child or make some alternative provision to ensure they get what they
                            need. </p>

                <h3>Now for the practical bit...</h3>
                <h6>Title description, Sep 2, 2017</h6>
                <br>
                <p>There are many different activities that you can do with your child(ren) which will stimulate the
                    right side of the brain resulting in development of their emotional intelligence, communication and
                    creativity. This can benefit them by providing a foundation for them to express themselves more
                    clearly and easily; and in turn can alleviate many potential arguments and contentious situations;
                    you know the ones I'm talking about cos we've all been there! <p>Below are some examples of fun,
                        activities you might want to try with your child to help exercise their right brain.</p>
