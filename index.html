        <h2>Are Our Kids Using Half their Brains!</h2>
        <h6>Lavin Lennon, July 21, 2021</h6>
        <br>
        <p>In early childhood (nursery / preschool) there appears to be an appreciation for development of both sides of
            the brain. Activities such as drawing, finger painting, singing, role play, play dough and number songs,
            writing and circle time are a few activities which focus on this development; very successfully might I add.
            However when children begin to grow and develop through their school careers the emphasis on developing both
            sides of the brain seem to diminish and greater emphasis is placed on the left side and are reinforced by
            way of tests such as CAT’s, SAT’s, GCSE.s etc...

                <p>Whilst children are still encouraged to participate in dance, music, drama and other creative
                    activities; this tends to be much more of an option than science, maths or English (which are
                    essential). If the decline in activities which develop the right side of your child’s brain begins
                    soon after children start primary school, what can we as parents do to continue this essential
                    development, it seems obvious doesn't it! provide a replacement to fill this void? If we sent our
                    children to school and suddenly the school stopped feeding them at lunchtimes, what would we do
                    (apart from find a new school!) That’s right we'd supply a packed lunch for the child or make some
                    alternative provision to ensure they get what they need. </p>
